A member of the Atlanta Veterans Integrated Services Network (VISN) #7, CAVHCS&rsquo; mission is to provide excellent services to veterans across the continuum of healthcare.</p><p>The East (Tuskegee) and West (Montgomery) campuses are approximately 40 miles apart. The East Campus is located on 170-acres of land situated in a rural setting adjacent to the historic Tuskegee University and Moton Field, home of the Tuskegee Airmen. The West Campus is situated on 52-acres, located in a residential community adjacent to city school property and approximately five miles east of downtown Montgomery. Services include: Primary Care at all four sites; Medical and Surgical Care; a broad range of Mental Health programs; Geriatrics and Extended Care, and a Homeless Domiciliary. Accreditations include the Joint Commission&nbsp;and the Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities (CARF).</p><p>CAVHCS&rsquo; Geriatrics, Extended Care and Rehabilitation Service&rsquo;s continuum of care includes initiatives that encompass the &ldquo;whole person&rdquo; concept.

Adoption of the Eden Alternative concept has created a home-like environment utilizing plants, pets and familiarization techniques. CAVHCS has been successful in maintaining low rates for pressure sores. The national average is 3.0 percent; CAVHCS maintains a .02 percentage rate.</p><p>One-stop access for Veterans and their families has been enhanced by the co-location of the VA Regional Office (VARO) building on the southeast corner of the West Campus complex, as well as, VARO staff housed within the Special Examinations Unit (Compensation &amp; Pension [C&amp;P]; Pre-military discharge; Persian Gulf; Agent Orange, etc.).

The Bob Stump VA Medical Center is the largest veteran health care facility within a 60,000 square mile area and is the fourth largest employer in the area. This facility is located in the mountains of north central Arizona, 96 miles northwest of Phoenix, in a tri-city community of approximately 100,000 people. The area is not highly industrialized and is noted for clean air, sunshine and relatively mild climate. As part of the Sunbelt, it is an area of rapid population growth, particularly for retired people and families raising young children.</p><p>NAVAHCS provides a continuum of primary and secondary level medical, rehabilitative and long-term care to veterans residing in northern Arizona. Acute medical care consists of primary and secondary inpatient medicine and ambulatory care, which includes general medicine, ambulatory surgery, mental hygiene, and selected specialized outpatient clinics. Primary level ambulatory care and screening services are provided at the main hospital, five CBOC, and one telemedicine&nbsp;sites. Rehabilitative care consists of a rehabilitation medicine unit, an outpatient substance abuse treatment program, vocational rehabilitation/job training program and a very active outpatient rehabilitative therapy program. Long term care consists of a Community Living Center (CLC), a Geriatric Evaluation, and Management Program (GEM and Domiciliary). Dementia, Hospice and Respite are programs offered in the CLC. Domiciliary care is a residential rehabilitation program that provides short-term rehabilitative care and long-term maintenance for veterans who require minimal medical and mental health care. Rehabilitative Care is directed towards the development of skills necessary for return to community-based living.</p><p>Routine and non-emergent care, inpatient surgical and complex medical and diagnostic procedures are referred to the VA facilities located in Phoenix and Tucson, Arizona. Emergent cases are referred to other VA and private sector health care facilities throughout the VA Contract Hospital Program.</p><p>NAVAHCS participates in student training programs in nursing, occupational therapy, physical therapy, social work, psychology, pharmacy and laboratory sciences.</p><h4>AFFILIATIONS</h4><blockquote><p>Arizona College of Osteopathy medical students</p></blockquote><h4>OPERATING BEDS</h4><blockquote><p>25 VA Hospital<br />85&nbsp;CLC<br />120 VA Domiciliary</p></blockquote><h4>TYPE OF FACILITY</h4><blockquote><p>General Medicine</p></blockquote><h4><a name=\"SPECIAL PROGRAMS\"></a>SPECIAL PROGRAMS</h4><blockquote><p>Care Coordination Home Telehealth (CCHT)<br />Domiciliary<br />Dementia Special Care&nbsp;Unit<br />Hospice&nbsp;Unit<br />Home Based Primary Care<br />Homeless<br />American Indian Outreach<br />Operation Enduring Freedom&nbsp;/ Operation Iraqi Freedom/ Operation&nbsp;New Dawn&nbsp;(OEF/OIF/OND)<br />Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)<br />Mental Health Intensive Case Management (MHICM)<br />Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)</p></blockquote>",

The VAMC provides primary and secondary care including acute medical, surgical and psychiatric inpatient services as well as a full range of outpatient services. Specialized programs include a Mental Health Care Center, same day surgery, observation beds, mobile MRI imaging. Patients requiring tertiary care are referred to the Salt Lake City VA Health Care System, Utah or the VA Eastern Colorado Health Care System at Denver, Colorado. When necessary and appropriate, care is provided locally on a contract or a fee-for-services basis. Through local agreements, the VAMC obtains radiation therapy and other specialized procedures. Scarce medical specialty agreements with community specialists make it possible to offer patients, orthopedics, neurology, ENT, and ophthalmology. In 1999 the VAMC opened a community based outpatient clinic in Montrose, Colorado, located 65 miles southeast of Grand Junction. The clinic serves a surrounding five county area and provides basic preventive, primary medical and mental health care.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;VAMC has since opened a Telehealth&nbsp;outreach clinics in Craig,&nbsp;and Glenwood Springs, Colorado and Moab Utah.&nbsp; <br /><br /><font size=\"4\"><strong>AFFILIATIONS</strong></font><br /><br />The Grand Junction VAMC has academic affiliation agreements with colleges and universities in Colorado, Utah, Arizona, Kansas, North Carolina and New Mexico.

Dr. William R. Berryman, former Medical Center Chief of Staff, pioneered the model and is considered THE source of expertise on its applications and benefits. In recognition, Dr. Berryman was the 1998 winner of the prestigious Mark Wolcott Award for Clinical Excellence. <br /><br />The National Disabled Veterans Winter Sports Clinic was conceived and developed in 1986 by&nbsp;the Medical Center's&nbsp;recreational staff.&nbsp; The week long annual clinic, co-sponsored by VA and DAV and hosted by the Grand Junction VAMC and VA Rocky Mountain Network, offers disabled veterans opportunities to experience and learn alpine and cross country skiing, rock climbing, scuba diving and various other sports and educational activities. The clinic, now in its 27th year, has touched the lives of thousands of disabled veterans as well as their family members and friends. Through a process of guided self-discovery, participants develop new skills and abilities they never thought possible, allowing them to rise above the limits imposed by their disabilities. The event draws nationwide acclaim and provides VA with very positive media exposure. Thanks to the Winter Sports Clinic, the Grand Junction VAMC is known throughout VA as a national center for adaptive sports.<br /><br />Results of the cyclical surveys conducted by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) stand as testament to this Medical Center's claims of high quality care and dedicated employees.&nbsp;Continuous efforts to provide high quality care once again resulted in full accreditation&nbsp;in 2007.&nbsp;<br /><br />The Medical Center conducted its first ever local Creative Arts Festival in 1998. The festival was a huge success and has now become an annual event.&nbsp;</p><p>The Medical Center continues to see a growth in demand for health care resources.&nbsp;&nbsp;It&nbsp;grew 3.9 percent in Fiscal Year 2012. &nbsp;Most importantly, these &quot;new&quot; users, who for various reasons had not accessed VA care, were provided with the care and service they so richly deserve.</p>",

The Rocky Mountain Network Office is located in Glendale, Colorado, a suburb of Denver. The Network spans over 470,000 square miles across several states and is one of the largest networks in terms of geographic area. Its service area covers the entire state of Utah; and nearly all of Colorado, Montana and Wyoming; and portions of Idaho, Kansas, Nebraska, Nevada and North Dakota. Network topography includes the Rocky Mountains, and areas subject to extreme winter weather. From late fall through spring, travel in the area is often difficult and sometimes impossible due to severe snow, wind and occasional road closures.</span></span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: x-small\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial\">Health care delivery is influenced by many factors, including the large geographic area, a wide range in population density and socioeconomic conditions. The population varies from large urban areas such as Denver, Colorado Springs, Colorado and Salt Lake City, Utah to rural and even frontier areas, especially in Montana and Wyoming.

The VISN encompasses an area containing VA medical centers and outpatient clinics in Alabama, Georgia and South Carolina. Approximately 190,000 unique veterans will be seen in VISN 7 in fiscal year 1999. Veterans are concentrated around moderate to large cities, military bases and along the coastal areas. Smaller concentrations of veterans are located in rural areas, which is considered medically underserved. The VISN spans approximately 79,876 square miles including most of South Carolina, Georgia and Alabama. The counties of southern Georgia, southwestern Alabama and northwestern Georgia are assigned to VISN 8, VISN 16 and VISN 9 respectively. &nbsp;</P>\n<P>VISN 7 medical centers are located in: Atlanta, GA; Augusta, GA; Birmingham, Al; Central Alabama Veterans Health Care System (east campus at Tuskegee, AL, west campus at Montgomery, AL); Charleston, SC; Columbia, SC; Dublin, GA; and Tuscaloosa, AL. </P>VISN 7 Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs) are located in: Albany, GA; Atlanta, GA (Midtown); Columbus, GA; Lawrenceville, GA; Macon, GA; Oakwood, GA; Smyrna, GA; Savannah, GA; Anderson, SC; Beaufort, SC; Florence, SC; Greenville, SC; Myrtle Beach, SC; Orangeburg, SC; Rock Hill, SC; Sumter, SC; Dothan, AL; Florence, AL; Gadsden, AL; Huntsville, AL; Jasper, AL; Madison, AL; and Oxford, AL. \n<P></P>\n<P>While total veteran population declines from 1994-2005 nationally, VISN 7 has the lowest percentage of decrease when compared to other VISNs. In reviewing the growth in the over-65 population, VISN 7 ranks second highest in percentage of increase. This VISN ranks sixth highest in percentage of patients in the chronic care category. This large increase in the over-65 population coupled with the already high percentage of patients receiving chronic care has resource implications and may affect the type and amount of services offered by the VISN in the future. </P></BLOCKQUOTE>",

Lovell Federal Health Care Center provides care to all eligible Veterans, active duty and their dependents.&nbsp; As a result of integrating Veteran and DoD patients, the total number of patients seen in the ED has more than doubled.&nbsp; FHCC Active Duty and civilian staff now provide inpatient and outpatient ENT, orthopedic and general surgical services, including pediatric procedures.&nbsp; Our residency programs have plans for a new residency program or expansion of existing residency programs in surgical services, internal medicine, and ophthalmology.&nbsp; We have established a new training position for a Hospitalist program.&nbsp; As a result of our VA/DoD partnership, our Emergency Department developed a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner Program (SANE) Program.&nbsp; This program completes the forensic evidence packages for sexually assaulted patients, thereby minimizing trauma for these patients.&nbsp; FHCC has developed a successful Mental Health Rapid Response Program. This program specifically focuses on patients at risk for suicide or depression.&nbsp; Our TBI Poly-Trauma Team is functioning and serving patients with Traumatic Brain Injury which is particularly important for our recently returned OEF/OIF Veterans.&nbsp; The Tumor Registry Board was initiated and we have trained staff now running this program.&nbsp; FHCC has a state of the art, permanent MRI serving our patient population.&nbsp; The 3-Telsa MRI has been functional since March 2007.&nbsp; The Oncology Program has expanded and now offers inpatient/outpatient services in conjunction with new Oncology/Hematology Infusion Center.&nbsp;</p><p><span lang=\"FR\">Outpatient Clinics / Vet Centers:</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>&nbsp; Evanston, Illinois Vet Cent<br />&nbsp; Evanston, Illinois CB<br />&nbsp; Kenosha, Wisconsin CBOC<br />&nbsp; Fisher Clinic (East campus)<br />&nbsp; USS Red Rover (East campus)<br />&nbsp; USS Osborne (East campu<br />&nbsp; USS Tranquillity (East campus)&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>FHCC is part of the Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN) 12, which includes Jesse Brown VA Health Care System; Hines VA Hospital; North Chicago VAMC; Milwaukee VAMC; Madison VA Hospital; Tomah VAMC; and Iron Mountain VAMC.&nbsp; These facilities make up a regional health care system that provides a full spectrum of health care.&nbsp;</p><p>FHCC has an affiliation with the Rosalind Franklin University of Medicine and Science, which is located adjacent to the facility on land leased.</p><p>FHCC provides training in health services administration, audiology/speech pathology, biomedical engineering, dental assisting, medical technology, pharmacy, nursing, physical therapy, podiatry, psychology, social work and many other areas.&nbsp; Over 400 residents, interns and students are trained each year.</p><p>The research programs at FHCC and Hines VA Hospital were consolidated during FY 1997.&nbsp; The primary objective of the amalgamation was to augment patient care by increasing the quantity and quality of research while reducing administrative cost.&nbsp; Biomedical and clinical research is ongoing in such areas as molecular biology, cardiology, oncology, alcoholism, immunology, diabetes, substance abuse, spinal cord injuries, speech pathology, aging, pulmonary, health care outcomes, infectious diseases, vision, psychiatric illness, rehabilitation medicine and behavioral sciences.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

Roudebush Indianapolis VA Medical Center, located 2 miles northwest of the heart of downtown Indianapolis, has been serving Indiana Veterans since 1932. As Indiana's tertiary care facility, Indianapolis VA Medical Center receives referrals from VA facilities at Ft. Wayne and Marion, Indiana, and from nearby Danville, Illinois. Indianapolis VA Medical Center provides acute inpatient medical, surgical, psychiatric, neurological, and rehabilitation care, as well as both primary and specialized outpatient services. Some noteworthy specialized services include comprehensive cardiac care, radiation oncology treatment and community based extended care. Indianapolis VA Medical Center is aggressively utilizing emerging technology in the tele-home care and tele-disease management arenas. The medical center serves as the site for the Veterans in Partnership VISN 11 Polytrauma Network Site. Additionally, the medical center has a 50-bed Domiciliary Residential Rehabilitation Treatment Program targeting homeless Veterans.</span></div><div style=\"margin: 5pt 0in; line-height: normal;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">The medical center operates three Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOC's) located in Bloomington, Indiana, Terre Haute, Indiana and &nbsp;Martinsville, IN. The more than 60,000 patients (3,700 women Veterans)&nbsp;treated by the Indianapolis VA Medical Center require&nbsp;over 613,000 outpatient visits and over 7,900 inpatient episodes of care yearly. The medical center embraces Veteran Centered Care. The Medical Center has nine sharing agreements with the Department of Defense and plays a key role in disaster preparedness as a federal designated coordinating center for National Disaster Medical System.</span></div><div style=\"margin: 5pt 0in; line-height: normal;\"><b><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">AFFILIATIONS:</span></b></div><div style=\"margin: 5pt 0in; line-height: normal;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">The Indianapolis VA Medical Center has an active affiliation with the Indiana University School of Medicine. At any time, 100 post-graduate physician residents and fellows are pursuing clinical training in the Indianapolis VA Medical Center and delivering veteran care under the supervision of VA physicians who are concurrently faculty of the Indiana University School of Medicine. This supervised clinical experience for licensed physicians is offered in 22 accredited medical specialties. There are also nursing student affiliations with the Indiana University School of Nursing as well as education arrangements with six other universities in Indiana and Kentucky involving dentistry, pharmacy, social work, allied health, and psychology.</span></div><div style=\"margin: 5pt 0in; line-height: normal;\"><b><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">CONSTRUCTION:</span></b></div><div style=\"margin: 5pt 0in; line-height: normal;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">The main part of the current medical center was opened in 1952, with about 450,000 square feet. There have been two major additions since then, in 1981 and 1994, bringing the total square footage of the medical center to approximately 1,000,000 square feet today. The 1981 addition is devoted to Dental, Dialysis and Research. The 1994 addition included ambulatory care clinics, new operating rooms, new intensive care units, the main clinical laboratory and education space. The medical center received $27 millionto construct two additional floors on the clinical addition. This replaced four current inpatient wards as well as the inpatient pharmacy and was activated in 2008. This addition provided appropriate patient privacy and bath facilities as well as adequate isolation capabilities. Phase II of the project to house outpatient mental health will be completed in Spring 2010. A new mental health inpatient unit will also open in Spring 2010. </span></div><div style=\"margin: 5pt 0in; line-height: normal;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">As part of grant funding received from the Lilly Endowment, Inc., the medical center has completed construction of an integrated clinic targeting the OEF/OIF returning service members. The Seamless Transition Integrated Care Clinic has implemented a new process with a &ldquo;one stop shop&rdquo; for services for returning service members. Included are primary care, specialty care, mental health services, vocational rehabilitation services, community resources, and other needed services. Extended hours and a&nbsp;family friendly environment is emphasized. </span></div><div style=\"margin: 5pt 0in; line-height: normal;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Another part of the Lilly Endowment grant that is supportive of the OEF/OIF Veterans is the construction of a <a href=\"http://www.indianapolis.va.gov/patients/veterans_house.asp\">Veterans House</a>. The Veterans House is modeled after the successful Fisher House program. We're operating a 28 suite facility that supports the families and the needs of returning service members. The Veterans House has been in operation now for more than a year and has already served nearly a thousand Veterans and their family members. </span></div><div style=\"margin: 5pt 0in; line-height: normal;\"><b><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">LABOR RELATIONS:</span></b></div><div style=\"margin: 5pt 0in; line-height: normal;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">The American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) Local 609 represents all professional employees and the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) Local 551 represents all non-professional employees at this medical center.</span></div><div style=\"margin: 5pt 0in; line-height: normal;\"><b><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">RESEARCH:</span></b></div><div style=\"margin: 5pt 0in; line-height: normal;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">The Indianapolis VA Medical Center houses a mid-sized research and development program. Research topics included stroke, cholesterol, and renal disease. The Health Services Research and Development Service was designated as a Center of Excellence on Implementing Evidence Based Practice. With the newly funded Research Enhancement Award Program (REAP) our Health Services research will focus on information management for patient centered treatment. The medical center was selected as the new coordinating center for the National Stroke QUERI study. The CIEBP supports 18 MD and PhD health service research scientists at one of the VHA's thirteen HSR&amp;D Centers of Excellence. CIEBP hosts the National Stroke Quality Enhanced Research Initiative (QUERI) Coordinating Center focused on translating stroke research discoveries into patient care and systems improvements.</span></div><div style=\"margin: 5pt 0in; line-height: normal;\"><b><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">LOCAL ISSUES:</span></b></div><div style=\"margin: 5pt 0in; line-height: normal;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">On September 12, 1996, a $9.8 million Enhanced Use Lease (EUL) Trust Fund (1996-i) was established by the State of Indiana for the Department of Veterans Affairs in return for a 35-year lease of the Cold Spring Road Division at the Richard L. Roudebush VA Medical Center, Indianapolis, Indiana.</span></div><div style=\"margin: 5pt 0in; line-height: normal;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">The medical center continues to conservatively utilize trust funds for needed enhancements for Veterans. The Trust Fund supported the activation of the new inpatient units, will support activation of the new outpatient mental health space, and negotiations are underway to support parking solutions at the medical center. All of the enhancements have come without expense to taxpayers.</span></div><div style=\"margin: 5pt 0in; line-height: normal;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Indy Excellence is the hallmark of the Indianapolis VA Medical Center. Begun in 2003, this cultural journey has been aimed at achieving extraordinary levels of service and operational excellence. Key components are employee satisfaction, patient satisfaction and leadership development. All employee Survey results have demonstrated significant improvement in employee perceptions related to promotion potential, praise, rewards, employee development and retention. Other positive results on the AES were shown in diversity acceptance, safety climate, innovation and cooperation, to name a few. The medical center has evolved to the point that the cultural journey teams and operational committees have merged.</span></div><div style=\"margin: 5pt 0in; line-height: normal;\"><b><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">AUTHORIZED BEDS</span></b></div><div style=\"margin: 5pt 0in; line-height: normal;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">229 authorized</span></div><div style=\"margin: 5pt 0in; line-height: normal;\"><b><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">TYPE OF FACILITY</span></b></div><div style=\"margin: 5pt 0in; line-height: normal;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Tertiary Care</span></div><div style=\"margin: 5pt 0in; line-height: normal;\"><b><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">SPECIAL PROGRAMS</span></b></div><div style=\"margin: 5pt 0in; line-height: normal;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Cardiac Surgery<br />Cardiac Catheterization<br />Radiation/Oncology<br />Intensive Care Units<br />OEF/OIF<br />Polytrauma Center<br />Inpatient Hemodialysis Center<br />Home Dialysis Program<br />Pulmonary Function Laboratory<br />Audiology and Speech Pathology<br />Alcohol and Drug Dependency Treatment (outpatient)<br />Home Based Primary Care<br />Mental Health Clinic<br />Nuclear Medicine Services<br />Orthopedic Services<br />Computerized Tomography/PET/MRI<br />Women Veterans<br />Homeless Program/HCMI Program<br />PT, OT, KT &amp; RT Services<br />Oral &amp; Maxillofacial Surgery<br />Prosthetics &amp; Sensory Aids<br />Electron Microscopy<br />Hoptel<br />Laser Treatment/Therapy<br />Sleep Lab<br />Palliative Care Unit<br />Orthopedic Surgery </span></div>",

Primary care clinics are available at both campuses and at Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs) located in South Bend and Muncie, Indiana. Although the Marion Campus is well over 110 years old and the Fort Wayne Campus was constructed in 1950, recently completed renovations and construction, and continuous maintenance, ensure an attractive, state-of-the-art healthcare environment. <p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>AFFILIATIONS</h2><blockquote><p>Ball State University<br />Butler University<br />Ferris State University<br />Indiana University<br />Indiana University/Fort Wayne Medical Education Program<br />Indiana Wesleyan University<br />Purdue University <br />&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Authorized Beds</h2><blockquote>243 Medical, Surgical and Mental Health<br />180 Nursing Home Care Unit Beds<br /></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Type of Facility</h2><blockquote>Primary and Secondary Medical and Surgical Care<br />Chronic and Acute Psychiatry Care<br />Nursing Home Care Unit<br />Extended Care<br /></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Special Programs</h2><blockquote>Dementia Unit<br />Home Based Primary Care<br />Post Traumatic Stress Disorder Clinic Team<br />Substance Abuse Treatment Program<br />Adult Day Health Care<br />Mental Health Intensive Case Management<br />Combat Veterans Treatment<br /></blockquote></blockquote>",

The employees of the Louisville Regional Office administer a full range of compensation and pension benefits for approximately 380,618 veterans in the state. These benefits include disability compensation and pension, death compensation, death pension and dependency and indemnity compensation, burial and accrued benefits, as well as many ancillary benefits such as clothing allowance and specially adapted equipment grants for motor vehicles. The office guarantees loans made to servicemembers, veterans, reservists and unremarried surviving spouses for the purchase or refinancing of homes, condominiums, and manufactured homes. The Vocational Rehabilitation and Counseling division provides comprehensive counseling and rehabilitation services using the most advanced methods and techniques for eligible veterans and their families to ensure their opportunity to obtain realistic and satisfying vocational and personal goals.<br /><br />The Louisville Regional Office is very proud of its Servicepersons Transition Examination Program outbased at Fort Knox, Kentucky which processes disability claims just prior to the servicepersons release from active duty. This program reduces normal processing time for such claims from several months to approximately two weeks. The success of the program can be attributed to the overall cooperation between the Department of the Army, the VA Medical Center in Louisville and the VA Regional Office in Louisville.<br /><br /><b>LIST OF SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS AND OTHER VA ACTIVITIES</b><br /><br />American Legion<br />AMVETS<br />Disabled American Veterans<br />Kentucky Department for Veterans Affairs<br />Military Order of the Purple Heart<br />Paralyzed Veterans of America<br />Veterans of Foreign Wars<br />District Counsel<br />Regional Office of Public Affairs<br />&nbsp;</p>",

The Hospital originally housed around 450 inpatient beds with minimal outpatient activity. </font></p><p align=\"left\"><font face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=\"2\">The Hospital was renamed the Overton Brooks VA Medical Center in 1988 in honor of former Louisiana 4th District Congressman Overton Brooks who is credited with placing the Medical Center in Shreveport.</font></p><p dir=\"ltr\" align=\"left\" style=\"margin-right: 0px\"><font face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=\"2\">Over the years, as healthcare has moved from the inpatient arena to outpatient services, the hospital has reduced the bed level from the original number to 112 beds today. Outpatient visits, on the other hand, have gone up dramatically, to well over 330,900 visits per year. The Medical Center serves a population of over 131,000 veterans residing within its primary service area which encompasses 15 northeast Texas counties, five southwestern Arkansas counties and 12 northwest Louisiana parishes. <br /><br />The Medical Center is affiliated with the Louisiana State University School of Medicine in Shreveport and has sharing agreements with the 2d Medical Group at Barksdale AFB and LSU Health Sciences Center. The VAMC provides tertiary care in medicine, surgery, neurology and psychiatry and a broad spectrum of outpatient services. The Ambulatory Care Program provides primary care services at the VAMC and at Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs) which were opened in Texarkana, Texas 1994; Monroe, Louisiana, 1995 and Longview, Texas 1999.</font></p></blockquote>",

In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, the New Orleans VAMC was devastated. SLVHCS reorganized to meet the needs of Veterans and now consists of eight community-based clinics located in New Orleans, Slidell, Hammond, St. John Parish, Houma, Franklin, Bogalusa and Baton Rouge. Ninety percent of patients live within 30 minutes of primary and mental health services. Specialty care is available through the New Orleans and Baton Rouge clinics and inpatient services are coordinated through community facilities and other Veterans Affairs Medical Centers. Programs are available for special needs populations including those with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and spinal cord injury.</p><p>&nbsp;SLVHCS has also expanded programs to provide additional services home-based community services. Home Based Primary Care, Respite Care, and Community Adult Day Care are just a few examples.&nbsp; SLVHCS is also one of only two national Hospital at Home Program sites, providing care to Veteran patients in their homes, shortening hospital stays and increasing patient comfort.&nbsp; To date, Hospital at Home admitted over 100 patients with a variety of conditions and offered them doctor-directed, nurse-provided care.&nbsp; Another option SLVHCS uses to expand care availability is the Care Coordination Tele-health Program, which allows Veterans to transmit vital signs such blood pressure and diabetic sugar levels from the comfort of their home to on-call nurses, reducing the need to come to a clinic for services.</p><p>Mental Health Services now include specialized Mental Health Programs such as Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, Homeless Services, Substance Abuse Treatment, home-based management of chronic mental illnesses (Mental Health Intensive Case Management, MHICM) and a compensated work therapy program. Specialized mental health programs are now available in New Orleans 3426, 3434 and 3500 Canal Street.</p><p>&nbsp;The OEF/OIF program has greatly expanded, with enrollment increasing nearly eightfold since Hurricane Katrina. In Fiscal Year 2009, over 4300 OEF/OIF Veterans were enrolled for care in SLVHCS, and outreach activities increased by 43%.&nbsp; Many Veterans of these wars are eligible for care up to five years after their discharge, and SLVHCS services will continue to grow to meet the need.</p><p>For clinic appointments call (800) 935-8387.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

Veterans are referred to the Minneapolis VA Health Care System&nbsp;for tertiary care.</p><p>The health care system also supports&nbsp;nine community-based outpatient clinics (CBOC), located in Bismarck, Dickinson, Grafton, Jamestown, Grand Forks, Minot,&nbsp;and Williston,&nbsp;N.D., &nbsp;as well as Fergus Falls and&nbsp;Bemidji,&nbsp;Minn.&nbsp; During the last two years, outpatient visits for the healthcare system and the CBOCs have steadily increased to well over 100,000 per year. The health care system had over 2,000 admissions into the hospital each year over the last two years. The&nbsp;CLC provides extended care through admissions of over 400 patients each year during the past two years.</p><p>The Fargo VA&nbsp;Health Care System&nbsp;employs&nbsp;846 employees with an annual budget of approximately $112 Million for medical care.&nbsp; An active research program and a successful academic affiliation with the University of North Dakota School of Medical and Health Sciences are maintained. It supports residencies in Internal Medicine, Psychiatry, Surgery, and provides training to allied health professionals. The health care system is a member of the Veterans Integrated Service Network 23 (VISN 23), which includes the states of North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Iowa, Nebraska, western Wisconsin, western Illinois, northern Kansas, northern Missouri, and eastern Wyoming.</p></blockquote><h2>Affiliations</h2><blockquote><p>University of North Dakota School of Medical and Health Sciences<br />Grand Forks, N.D.</p><p>North Dakota State College of Science<br />Wahpeton, N.D.</p><p>Minnesota State University Moorhead<br />Moorhead, Minn.</p></blockquote><h2>Authorized Beds</h2><blockquote><p>42&nbsp;Authorized&nbsp;<br />38 Transitional Care Unit</p></blockquote><h2>Type of Facility</h2><blockquote><p>General Medical &amp; Surgery</p></blockquote><h2>Special Programs</h2><blockquote><p>Acute Psychiatry <br />Anatomic Pathology<br />Audiology<br />Blood Banking<br />Cardiology<br />Clinical Pharmacy<br />Gastroenterology <br />General Lab<br />ICU General (Medical and Surgical)<br />Infectious Disease<br />Microbiology Lab<br />Nephrology<br />Neurology<br />Nuclear Medicine<br />Occupational Therapy<br />Oncology<br />Optometry<br />Outpatient Substance Abuse<br />Pharmacokinetics Lab<br />Physical Therapy<br />Prosthetics<br />Recreation Therapy<br />Rehabilitation Medicine<br />Respiratory Therapy<br />Speech Therapy<br />Voluntary Service<br /><br /><strong>The following Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs) come under this facility:<br /><br /></strong></p><blockquote><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt\"><span style=\"font-size: 9pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\"><u>Bemidji, Minn.</u></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt\"><span style=\"font-size: 9pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\">Bemidji VA Community Based Outpatient Clinic<br />705 5th St NW Suite B<br />Bemidji,&nbsp;MN 56601<br />Phone: (218) 755-6360<o:p></o:p></span></p><p><u>Bismarck, N.D.<br /></u>Bismarck VA Community Based Outpatient Clinic<br />Gateway Mall<br />2700 State Street<br />Suite 5<br />Bismarck, N.D.&nbsp; 58503&nbsp;<br />Phone: 701-221-9169<br />Fax:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 701-221-0918<br /><br /><u>Dickinson, N.D.<br /></u>Dickinson VA Community Based Outpatient Clinic<br />528 - 21st St. W.

The Regional Office provides benefits to approximately 147,928 veterans. The office oversees a benefits delivery program that awards over $363 million annually in compensation and pension benefits. The Regional Office presently employs 220 people. Its out-based offices are located at the VAMC-Omaha and the Air Force Base at Offutt. <br /><br />While population is concentrated heavily in the eastern one third of the state, service to veterans and beneficiaries is provided to all areas, some as far as 500 miles from the Regional Office. Throughout Nebraska, our staff conducts training seminars, benefits presentations, performs outreach services, assists in emergency relief activities, and participates in a variety of community workshops, seminars, and public forums. The staff also participates in workshops for the County Veterans Services Officers. <br /><br /><b>SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS:</b>&nbsp;</div><ul type=\"disc\" style=\"margin-top: 0in\"><li style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt\">Disabled American Veterans (402) 420-4025</li><li style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt\">Nebraska Department Of Veteran's Affairs (402) 420-4021</li><li style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt\">Paralyzed Veterans Association (402) 420-4017</li><li style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt\">Military&nbsp;Order&nbsp;Of&nbsp;The&nbsp;Purple&nbsp;Heart&nbsp;(402) 420-4337</li><li style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt\">Nebraska County Veterans Service Officers -&nbsp;Click <a href=\"http://www.vets.state.ne.us/cvso.html\"><font color=\"#800080\">here</font></a> to find your service officer in your county</li></ul><div style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt 0.25in\">&nbsp;</div><div style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt 0.25in\">&nbsp;</div><div style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt\"><b>SPECIAL PROGRAMS:<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></b></div><div style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt\">On October 13, 2009, Secretary Shinseki announced his intent to establish presumptive service connection for Ischemic Heart Disease, Parkinson&rsquo;s disease, and Hairy Cell Leukemia for Veterans who served in the Republic of Vietnam.&nbsp;Under the Nehmer court order, VA must readjudicate previously denied claims for Ischemic Heart Disease, Parkinson&rsquo;s disease, or Hairy Cell Leukemia filed by Vietnam Veterans.&nbsp;With this announcement the Lincoln Regional Office&rsquo;s Development Resource Center became a Day One Brokering Center (D1BC) with a focus on Nehmer review and readjudication.&nbsp;The Lincoln Regional Office is currently responsible for processing over 5,300 claims from seven different Regional Offices.&nbsp;The seven different regional offices include Chicago, Milwaukee, Des Monies, Little Rock, Sioux Falls, Lincoln, and Wichita.</div><div style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</div><div style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt\">The Lincoln Regional Office has been chosen to serve as one of two Fiduciary Hubs within the Central Area.&nbsp;The Fiduciary Hub will be located within the Regional Office and will consolidate approximately one-half of the current Central Area fiduciary workload.</div><div style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt\"><br /><b>LOCAL INITIATIVES</b></div><div style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt\"><b><u>Pre-Discharge:</u></b> In February 1998, the Lincoln Regional Office implemented an out-based initiative at Offutt Air Force Base.

Access to a wide variety of specialists is available through the primary providers. In addition to general medical, psychiatry, and long-term care, a full range of medical and surgical subspecialty care is provided to Veterans of the VANJHCS in a variety of special programs as listed below. Because the VANJHCS is dedicated to developing programs that meet all Veterans' needs, teams of physicians, nurses, therapists, social workers and others all work together to develop programs of distinction that often become models for the health care field. <br /><br />The System's Diabetes Education, Pulmonary Rehabilitation, Prosthetics, Homeless Outreach Programs, and others have been recognized for outstanding achievement both within the Department of Veterans Affairs and the general health care community. A recognized leader in research, the VANJHCS maintains a very active research program with over 60 investigators conducting pioneering work in areas such as infectious disease, cardiovascular disease, and the health effects of smoking.

The Medical Center is situated on a historic site in the borough of the Bronx.&nbsp;Located on the highest point in New York City, it served as a strategic vantage point during the Revolutionary War.&nbsp;In 1847 Frederick Bailey bought several acres of land where the hospital now stands. After his death In 1889, Bailey's heirs sold the estate to the Sisters of Charity of the Catholic Archdiocese of New York.&nbsp;The Sisters of Charity constructed and operated an orphanage on the site until 1920. The Boy's Chapel, built in the 1800's, remains on the campus and is used daily.</p><p><br />In 1921, the Treasury Department purchased the property from the Archdiocese of New York for use by the U.S. Public Health Service as a hospital for ex-service patients suffering from mental and nervous disorders. The purchase was turned over to the newly formed U.S. Veterans&rsquo; Bureau by Executive Order on April 20, 1922.</p><p><br />By adding several buildings throughout the years the Bureau made the Bronx hospital the second largest VA facility in the nation, with a total of 1,663 beds, and the first veteran&rsquo;s hospital in New York City.&nbsp;More recently, a 9-floor replacement facility was built through the late 70&rsquo;s and dedicated in 1981.&nbsp;The modern replacement hospital includes an adjoining 2-floor nursing home and a 5-floor Research Building.</p>",

In addition to our traditional clinics, our outpatient service also include Care Coordination Home Tele-health (CCHT) and Home Based Primary Care (HBPC).</font></o:p></span></p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"text-align: justify; margin: 0in 0in 0pt\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'\"><o:p><font size=\"3\">The SORCC provides a residential program with a two-fold mission of providing bio-psychosocial rehabilitation and long-term health maintenance. The SORCC offers an appropriate level of care for Veterans who do not require acute hospitalization or nursing home care but who cannot adequately provide for themselves in the community, and therefore need residential support. The SORCC adheres to Patient Centered Care Methodologies and Philosophy and provides safety, shelter, and food in a therapeutic, semi-structured, clean and sober environment. The SORCC provides a Holistic foundation for healthy lifestyle choices, effective social-skill building and higher-level clinical interventions and services when needed; all components to assist the Veteran in achieving optimal levels of functional independence, personal empowerment and health living. Although the primary SORCC program objective is to restore Veterans to independent or semi-independent community living, some Veterans require long-term health care maintenance.<br /></font></o:p></span></p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"text-align: justify;

            "description": "<p>The H.J. Heinz&nbsp;Campus is located in O'Hara Township, a few miles northeast of Pittsburgh. Classified as a Geriatric Center of Excellence, the 262-bed community living center has transitional care beds and offers outpatient services including audiology &amp; speech pathology, dental, primary care, and pharmacy.</p><p>Our commitment to an all encompassing Geriatric Care Program includes recent renovations of the palliative and hospice care environment as well as the implementation, including renovations, of the Eden Alternative on the Dementia Specialty Care Unit. Our one-of-a-kind Palliative and Hospice Care Program provides a continuum of care to veteran patients who are making the transition into end-of-life. The Eden Alternative encourages putting the &quot;home&quot; in nursing home and eliminating the plagues of boredom, hopelessness, frustration and loneliness. It reinforces the importance of close contact with living things.</p><p>The H.J.&nbsp;Heinz Campus is now also home to a modern, 96-bed Veterans Recovery Center. In addition to a homeless domiciliary, programs located here include vocational services, health care for homeless veterans, and psychiatric residential rehabilitation treatment program.</p><p><img height=\"120\" alt=\"Residential villas at the H. John Heinz III VA Progressive Care Center\" hspace=\"8\" width=\"190\" align=\"right\" src=\"http://www.pittsburgh.va.gov/PITTSBURGH/images/villas_web.jpg\" />A first of their kind in 2008, the residential living villas of the Veterans Recovery Center set a new standard in the architectural design and clinical operation of a traditional domiciliary, creating an environment of &quot;veterans living in the community&quot; and providing improved resources for homeless and vocational veterans.</p><p>Also opened in 2008, a new environmentally-friendly administration building houses numerous administrative departments including human resources, business service, contracting, fiscal and medical records.</p><h3>HISTORY</h3><p>Construction for the original buildings of this VA campus began in June 1924. The first patient was admitted to the hospital on October 12, 1925, and by the late 1940s, as many as 1,100 inpatients were crowded into the facility.</p><p><img height=\"130\" alt=\"H. John Heinz III VA Progressive Care Center\" hspace=\"8\" width=\"190\" align=\"right\" src=\"http://www.pittsburgh.va.gov/PITTSBURGH/images/aspinwall_web.jpg\" /> After serving as a general medical and surgery hospital and the first VA Allergy Clinic, all general medical and surgical services were transferred to the University Drive Division when it opened in 1954. The patient census at the Aspinwall campus declined and the hospital was scheduled for closure. In 1964, the Veterans Administration responded to the changing health care needs of the aging veteran population by beginning a nursing home initiative. This facility responded to a new challenge and began serving the long term care needs of the elderly veterans.</p><p><img height=\"128\" alt=\"Senator H. John Heinz III\" hspace=\"8\" width=\"90\" align=\"right\" src=\"http://www.pittsburgh.va.gov/PITTSBURGH/images/Senator_Heinz_web.jpg\" />A new and modern replacement hospital was designed and two special purpose buildings were integrated into a complete long-term care center. Patients were moved to the new hospital on November 5, 1994. On March 22, 1999, a dedication ceremony was held to rename this campus the H. John Heinz III Progressive Care Center, after the late U.S. Senator John Heinz, who recognized the importance of caring for our nation's veterans. Without his efforts, the modern long term care facility would not exist today.</p>",

Heinz and University Drive campuses, the Highland Drive campus will be&nbsp;closed.</p><h3>HISTORY</h3><p>Construction of a neuropsychiatric hospital authorized by President Harry S. Truman on March 22, 1947, began in the spring of 1950. Much cutting and filling of earth was required to suit the layout of the hospital buildings, and over 650,000 cubic yards of overburden and 6,000 tons of coal were removed from the site. The total cost of construction for this hospital was $19,447,176, part of which was raised with Series E War Bonds sold by Mrs. F.P. Tarnapowicz (&quot;Tarney&quot;). The original campus included five patient treatment buildings, roads, parking lots, sidewalks, and a 500,000 gallon water tower.</p><p><img height=\"120\" alt=\"Highland Drive 1998\" hspace=\"10\" width=\"190\" align=\"right\" src=\"http://www.pittsburgh.va.gov/PITTSBURGH/images/aerial_hd-98_web.jpg\" />The Leech Farm Road Hospital was dedicated on November 29, 1953, and the first patient was admitted two days later. The original hospital had 951 operating beds and an average daily census of 900 patients. Early research studies beginning in 1954, included physiological, psychological, and sociological aspects of schizophrenia and problems in the area of neurological disorders.</p><p>In 1975 a ceremony dedicated the name change of the hospital from Leech Farm Road to Highland Drive. The Highland Drive Division is a campus-style facility composed of more than 20 buildings on 168 acres. Throughout its history Highland Drive served as a stand-alone VA Medical Center with medical and surgical services. On November 1, 1996, the Highland Drive VAMC consolidated with the University Drive VAMC and the H. John Heinz III Progressive Care Center to become the VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System under one management.</p>",

The Rock Hill Primary Care Clinic serves veterans in the counties of Cherokee, Chester, Lancaster and York. Because of its close proximity and the ease of access, the Clinic also provides care to some patients in the South Charlotte (Mecklenberg County), North Carolina area. The Clinic was dedicated on Veterans Day 1999 and began seeing patients in January 2000. This is an appointment-only Clinic, providing primary care Monday through Friday. Clinical staff for the Rock Hill Veterans Affairs Primary Care Clinic is provided through a contract with Piedmont Medical Center. Administrative staff are Department of Veterans Affairs employees. When the Clinic opened initially, it was anticipated that 3,200 to 3,500 patients would be seen annually; however, more than 1,000 veterans attended the Dedication Ceremony and demand for care has far exceeded our expectations. We now anticipate that this Clinic will see approximately 5,000 veterans a year. Primary Care and Mental Health services. Hours of operation: 8-4:30 Mon-Fri. Distance to Columbia VAMC: 77.</p>",

From primary care to the latest medical technologies and research, the Network is a healthcare leader and innovator nationwide as well as in the communities it serves.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Over 10,000 full time staff are dedicated to providing area veterans a full range of quality and cost-effective medical, specialty, psychiatric, and extended care services. The Network maintains five nursing home care units, two long term psychiatric care programs, a multi-state domiciliary, regional referral centers for spinal cord injuries and prosthetics and national referral centers for all solid organ transplants, flow cytometry and photopheresis. It is a vital link to the education and training of area healthcare professionals through the Network's affiliations with seven medical schools. These same affiliations support basic, clinical and applied research in a variety of areas to further enhance patient care.</p><p>A high priority for the Mid South Network is not only the scope of services provided, but <i>how</i> those services are delivered. Improving customer satisfaction, service efficiencies and more convenient access to primary and preventive care are key areas of focus to ensure the Network is the healthcare provider of choice for veterans.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong><font color=\"#800000\">Our Partners</font></strong><br />The Network is currently working with a number of partners including the Department of Defense and state health departments within its geographic boundaries to enable veterans to obtain convenient and quality healthcare thirty minutes or thirty miles from home. A Management Assistance Council provides key stakeholder groups a forum regarding healthcare delivery and customer satisfaction. Each medical center further encourages stakeholder participation through facility committees and task forces to ensure additional grassroots involvement.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Network's resources and customer service attitude extend far beyond the walls of its facilities to support the broader needs of the communities it serves. All seven facilities are chamber of commerce members, partners with local and state government agencies, and active participants in local education programs, community health initiatives, and the United Way.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong><font color=\"#800000\">Need more information?<br /></font></strong>For more information about the VA Mid South Healthcare Network, please visit our website at <a href=\"http://www.visn9.va.gov\">www.visn9.va.gov</a>.</p>",

DeBakey VA Medical Center (MEDVAMC), is located in Lufkin, Texas.&nbsp; Activated on March 23, 1991, the 19,300 square foot clinic located at 1301 West Frank has established a reputation for delivering high quality health care to the Veterans of deep East Texas. </span></span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-size: medium\"><span style=\"font-size: small\">A staff of 55 provides primary care, laboratory, radiology, pharmacy, social work, nutrition, and mental health services to Veterans in the area. In fiscal year 2010, there were 49,423 outpatient visits to the clinic.</span></span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-size: medium\"><span style=\"font-size: small\">In 1998, the clinic installed a state of the art digital radiological system, the first in East Texas. The following year, the VA&rsquo;s Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) was implemented at the clinic. CPRS offers health care providers a complete electronic record covering all aspects of patient care, including reminders for preventive health care, electronic entry of pharmaceutical orders, display of laboratory results, consultation requests, x-rays, and pathology slides. The importance of this system was demonstrated after Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Medical information for every New Orleans VA patient was available at any VA medical center and by any VA physician nationwide. </span></span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-size: medium\"><span style=\"font-size: small\">On June 7, 2000, the Lufkin Mental Health Annex at 1514 Ellis opened to provide additional mental health services for its Veterans.</span></span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-size: medium\"><span style=\"font-size: small\">In 2004, the clinic installed new laboratory technology to enable additional testing to be completed in-house. The same year, the ScriptPro 200 Robotic Prescription Dispensing Systems was installed to perform the time consuming and tedious tasks of counting, filling, and labeling prescriptions, allowing staff to spend more time with customers.&nbsp; The &ldquo;200&rdquo; in the name indicates the system is designed to dispense the 200 medications &ldquo;most-filled&rdquo; in the clinic pharmacy.</span></span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-size: medium\"><span style=\"font-size: small\">The VA outpatient clinic was officially renamed under Public Law 108-422 (S. 424) in honor of former U.S. Representative Charles Wilson. A renaming ceremony was held on July 7, 2005.</span></span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-size: medium\"><span style=\"font-size: small\">Wilson, born in Trinity, Texas, received a bachelor&rsquo;s degree from the United States Naval Academy in 1956 and served in the United States Navy, with rank of lieutenant from 1956 to 1960. He was elected to the Texas House of Representatives in 1960 and then elected to the Texas Senate in 1966. In 1973, Wilson was elected to the 93rd United States Congress and served as a U.S. Representative until 1997.</span></span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-size: medium\"><span style=\"font-size: small\">In 2007, the Charles Wilson VA Outpatient Clinic accepted funds from the T.L.L. Foundation to operate a 50-passenger coach with a restroom and capacity for two wheelchair bound passengers to transport Veterans from Lufkin to the MEDVAMC.</span></span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-size: medium\"><span style=\"font-size: small\">On August 28, 2009, the Charles Wilson VA Outpatient Clinic officially opened the doors of its new home at 2206 North John Redditt Drive. </span></span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-size: medium\"><span style=\"font-size: small\">Located on approximately seven acres of land on the west side of Lufkin just off Loop 287, this 37,000 square-foot facility replaced both the current Lufkin VA Outpatient Clinic located at 1301 West Frank Avenue and the Mental Health Clinic Annex at 1514 Ellis Avenue, a significant convenience for Veterans and staff who frequently travel between locations. </span></span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-size: medium\"><span style=\"font-size: small\">In primary care, the new clinic has eight provider offices, eight nurse offices, 24 examination rooms, a pulmonary function laboratory, and an observation room. On the mental health side of the building, there are 15 rooms for clinical staff and three group therapy rooms. The space for the laboratory, radiology, and pharmacy departments more than doubled in size. The new facility has 250 parking spaces, approximately three times that of the building at 1301 West Frank Avenue. In the near future, optometry services will also be offered.</span></span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-size: medium\"><span style=\"font-size: small\"><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 11pt; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA\"><strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.houston.va.gov/pressreleases/News_20100210.asp\">VA Mourns Passing of Charlie Wilson, February 10, 2010</a></strong></span></span></span>&nbsp;</p>",

These benefits include Compensation and Pension programs, Home Loan Guaranty, Vocational Rehabilitation and Counseling, and Death Benefits.<br /><br />Located in the third largest city in the United States, territorial jurisdiction includes San Antonio, the ninth largest city in the nation and home to five major military installations and one of the largest military retirement centers in the world, and South Texas, an area with increasing attraction for retirees from colder areas of the country. The Regional Loan <font color=\"#000000\">Center, </font><font color=\"#0000ff\">located at</font> the Houston RO administers all<strong> </strong><font color=\"#0000ff\">VA Home Loans</font><strong> </strong>activities for the States of Texas, Louisiana, <font color=\"#0000ff\">Oklahoma and Arkansas.</font></font></p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 12pt\"><font face=\"Arial\">The Regional Office, collocated with the VA Medical Center, is housed in a VA-owned building specifically constructed for the regional office. It was VA's first federal/private partnership accomplished under its unique Enhanced-Use program designed to improve services and reduce government costs. By using this concept, VA entered into a 35-year development partnership with a local developer to obtain needed facilities and services at lower costs, generate revenues, and redevelop underused VA land using private funds and expertise. Results included an attractive, cost-effective, state of the art benefits office; improved services to area veterans by providing a single location for benefits and medical care; substantial savings over the term of the agreement, and making revenues available to support veteran programs. At the end of the 35-year partnership, ownership of all private development will revert to VA.<br /><br />The project's overall economic benefits are further magnified as VA will share with the developer the financial benefits generated by private development on the site. In addition to an up-front payment, VA will receive minimum annual payments plus a percentage of the developer's receipts from the retail center, estimated at over $2 million for the term of the agreement. VA will use these revenues to help fund costs of its medical care and nursing home programs. Additionally VA will share in the residual value derived from private facilities developed on the site since ownership of the non-VA development will transfer to VA at the end of the lease.</font></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

In 1978, the clinic relocated, from the trailer, to a structure of approximately 5,000 square feet. After continuous workload increase and the need for more space, a new facility was built and leased to the VA for use by the clinic. This facility, consisting of approximately 27,000 square feet, opened in August 1991.&nbsp; The clinic area of availability encompasses the seven southern counties of Texas and is comprised of approximately 40,000 veterans. During the winter, the veteran population increases significantly due to the influx of winter visitors to the area. </font></p><p><font face=\"vardana,arial,Helvetica\" size=\"2\">Primary Care Services are provided at the clinic. These services include medical, psychiatry, psychology, geriatric endocrinology, urology, surgical, podiatry, gynecology and flexible sigmoidoscopy. Ancillary services provided at the clinic are pharmacy, physical therapy, laboratory, radiology, social service and dietary.</font></p><p><font face=\"vardana,arial,Helvetica\" size=\"2\">The Clinic in conjunction with the South Texas Family Practice Residency program in McAllen and with the <a href=\"http://www.uthscsa.edu\">University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio</a> participate in teaching family practice residents.

DeBakey VA Medical Center serves as the primary health care provider for almost 130,000 veterans in southeast Texas. Veterans from around the country are referred to the MEDVAMC for specialized diagnostic care, radiation therapy, surgery, and medical treatment including cardiovascular surgery, gastrointestinal endoscopy, nuclear medicine, ophthalmology, and treatment of spinal cord injury and diseases. The MEDVAMC is home to a Post Traumatic Stress Disorder Clinic; Network Polytrauma Center; an award-winning Cardiac and General Surgery Program; Liver Transplant Center; VA Epilepsy and Cancer Centers of Excellence; VA Substance Abuse Disorder Quality Enhancement Research Initiative; Health Services Research &amp; Development Center of Excellence; VA Rehabilitation Research of Excellence focusing on mild to moderate traumatic brain injury; Mental Illness Research, Education and Clinical Center; and one of the VA&rsquo;s six Parkinson&rsquo;s Disease Research, Education, and Clinical Centers. In late 2012, the MEDVAMC received official designation as a Kidney Transplant Center. Including the outpatient clinics in Beaumont, Conroe, Galveston, Houston, Lufkin, Richmond, and Texas City, MEDVAMC outpatient clinics logged almost 1.2 million outpatient visits in fiscal year 2012.</p><p><strong>Teaching Hospital</strong></p><p>Almost 3,900 health care professionals provide high quality care to our Veterans. For more than 50 years, the MEDVAMC has provided clinical training for health care professionals through our major affiliate, <a title=\"Baylor College of Medicine\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.bcm.edu/\">Baylor College of Medicine</a>* (BCM). MEDVAMC operates one of the largest VA residency programs with 269.7 slots in 40 sub-specialties. Each academic year, more than 1,972 students are trained through 144 affiliation agreements with institutions of higher learning in 19 states. Health care students from fields such as nursing, dietetics, social work, physical therapy, and a wide variety of medical specialties receive training here each year. Affiliation agreements also include training opportunities for health care administration, health information technology, medical records billing and coding, and health education students. This responsibility serves to enhance the quality of care provided to our Veterans. As a member institution of the <a title=\"Texas Medical Center\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.tmc.edu/\">Texas Medical Center</a>* (TMC) since 1985, the MEDVAMC staff serves on various TMC oversight committees that contribute to improved patient care and hospital operations. The vast majority of MEDVAMC physicians are also faculty members of Baylor College of Medicine.</p><p><strong>Awards and Accreditation</strong></p><p>The MEDVAMC has received national awards and honors including accreditation from <a title=\"Joint Commission\" href=\"http://www.jointcommission.org/\"><font color=\"#0066cc\">Joint Commission</font></a>* for hospital, long-term care, behavioral health care, home care, and substance abuse. The hospital is consistently recognized for demonstrating low observed-to-expected mortality rates in general surgery, all surgery, and all non-cardiac surgery. In 2011, the medical center&rsquo;s Pathology and Laboratory Medicine was awarded accreditation by the Accreditation Committee of the College of American Pathologists and its Psychosocial Rehabilitation and Recovery Center was awarded a 3-year accreditation by Rehabilitation Accreditation Commission (CARF). The MEDVAMC earned the Gold Seal of Approval&trade; in 2011 from the Joint Commission as an Advanced Primary Stroke Center. The MEDVAMC is the first VA medical center with this designation. In May 2012, MEDVAMC was awarded specialty accreditation by the American Psychological Association Commission on Accreditation for its Clinical Neuropsychology Postdoctoral Program. The MEDVAMC Clinical Neuropsychology Fellowship is one of only 18 APA specialty, accredited Clinical Neuropsychology Fellowships. The same year, the MEDVAMC&rsquo;s Health Care for Homeless Veterans, Domiciliary Care for Homeless Veterans, and Vocational Rehabilitation Programs; Comprehensive Integrated Inpatient Rehabilitation Program; and Inpatient and Outpatient Amputee System of Care Program were awarded 3-year accreditations by CARF.</p><p><strong>Modern Facility</strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Located on a 118-acre campus and built in 1991, MEDVAMC is a state-of-the-art facility with 357 acute care beds, a 40-bed Spinal Cord Injury Center, and a 141-bed Community Living Center. It also has a 40-bed domiciliary residence for homeless Veterans. An automated, computer-controlled transport system delivers food, laundry, and supplies throughout the building. The six-story granite building is designed with four exterior sections and four atriums that contain patio gardens, wheelchair basketball courts, and a rehabilitation pool.</p><p><strong>Research &amp; Development</strong></p><p>Research conducted by MEDVAMC staff ensures Veterans access to cutting-edge medical and health care technology. With 641 active research projects, the MEDVAMC Research &amp; Development (R&amp;D) Program is an integral part of the medical center&rsquo;s mission and plays a very important role in the health care Veterans receive. The production of new knowledge, techniques, and products has led to improved prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and control of disease. The MEDVAMC R&amp;D Program includes four components: Biomedical Laboratory Research and Development, Clinical Science Research and Development, Rehabilitation Research and Development, and Health Services Research and Development (HSR&amp;D). Collectively, these services support research covering biomedicine, clinical trials, rehabilitation, and health services. In 2012, the HSR&amp;D was selected by the VA as one of six sites for a Collaborative Research to Enhance and Advance Transformation and Excellence initiative, which is a collaborative effort with a wide variety of VA system partners to address high-priority, VA system-wide issues. Houston will receive $4.3 million for this initiative. Today, VA is a leader in many areas of research. The MEDVAMC is a leader in recruitment efforts for The Million Veteran Program (MVP): A Partnership with Veterans. MVP is a national research program to study how genes affect health and illness, with the goal of improving health care for Veterans. The Houston Center for Quality of Care and Utilization Studies is one of 14 VA Health Services Research and Development Centers of Excellence. Established in 1990, the Houston center systematically examines the impact of the organization, management and financing of health care services on the delivery, quality, cost, utilization, and outcomes of care.&nbsp;</p><table border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"3\" width=\"100%\" align=\"center\"><tbody><tr><td valign=\"top\" bordercolor=\"#ffffff\"><font color=\"#000000\" size=\"1\">* </font></td><td bordercolor=\"#ffffff\" align=\"left\"><font color=\"#000000\" size=\"1\">This link will take you outside of the Department of Veterans Affairs Web site and will open in a new window.

Dallas, San Antonio, Temple, Waco, Kerrville, Bonham and the former Marlin VA medical center &ndash; and a handful of community-based outpatient clinics. &nbsp;Shortly after its formation the Network&rsquo;s seven medical centers were integrated to form three integrated health care systems &ndash; Bonham and Dallas became the VA North Texas Health Care System; Temple, Waco and the former Marlin facility became the Central Texas Veterans Health Care System; and San Antonio and Kerrville became the South Texas Veterans Health Care System.&nbsp;Today the Network, which employs almost 10,000 health care professionals operating under a budget of approximately $1.6 billion, is providing state-of-the-art health care, education, and research to enrolled veterans residing along either side of the &ldquo;Interstate 35 corridor&rdquo; of Texas. &nbsp;The three health care systems are supported by a Network of over 37 community-based outpatient clinics providing a full range of primary care and some specialty care services through VA-staffed or contract care. &nbsp;Some of the largest and most complex outpatient clinics are in Fort Worth, Austin, San Antonio, Corpus Christi, McAllen, and Harlingen.&nbsp;The outpatient clinics work in harmony with the larger and more complex medical centers serving as referral sources for medical centers and providing needed long-term follow-up and rehabilitative care and post hospital admission. &nbsp;Network facilities also house six nursing homes, four domiciliaries, one blind rehabilitation center, and two Spinal Cord Injury Centers. &nbsp;Principle academic affiliations are with University of Texas Southwestern School of Medicine, Texas A&amp;M School of Medicine, the University of Texas Galveston Branch and the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio.</span></span></div><div style=\"margin: 0in 0in 1.5pt;

The George H. O&rsquo;Brien, Jr. VA Medical Center is located in Big Spring, Texas and the six Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOC&rsquo;s) that comprise the remainder of the health care system are located in Abilene, TX, Stamford, TX, San Angelo, TX, Odessa, TX, Fort Stockton, TX, and Hobbs, NM. Two Vet Centers also provide services and are located in Abilene, TX and Midland, TX. Approximately 17,000 (30%) of the 55,876 Veterans who reside within the service area receive care from the WTVAHCS.</p><p><br />Though the medical center maintains a 20 bed inpatient unit, no patients have been admitted since February of 2012. The average daily census, however for the 40 bed Community Living Center and the 40 bed Domiciliary is currently 80% and 85%, respectively. On average, the health care system supports over 155,000 outpatient visits annually. The WTVAHCS, due to the extreme rural geography of its catchment area, employs creative methods by which to serve its Veterans. These methods include: a robust Home-Based Primary Care Program, a diverse and rapidly expanding Telehealth Program, a solid cadre of Non-Institutional Care Programs, a strong tertiary referral system, and use of Non VA Coordinated Care. Gradually, the expertise and mission of the WTVAHCS has shifted from that of an inpatient hospital to an outpatient leader in rural health care and telehealth services.</p><p><br />Providing continuity, access, and appropriate services to the Veterans within the WTVAHCS service area will require both capital and non-capital solutions. Establishing and expanding partnerships with academic affiliates, other federal health care facilities, non federal health care facilities, and even proximal VA Medical Centers in VISNs 17 and 18 will be crucial to future delivery of health care services to rural Veterans in West Texas and Eastern New Mexico. Moreover, repurposing space formerly dedicated to services for which there is diminished demand to services that have experienced an increase in utilization will comprise a compendium of non-capital solutions to narrowing and meeting gaps. <br />&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></span></div></span><span style=\"font-family: Arial\">Affiliations<o:p></o:p></span></h2><p><strong><span style=\"font-family: Arial\">Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, Lubbock, Texas</span></strong><b><span style=\"font-family: Arial\"><br /><br /><strong><span style=\"font-family: Arial\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Jackson Federal Building, also known as the &quot;JFB&quot; or the &quot;New Federal Building,&quot; is located adjacent to the earliest pioneer settlement and origin of the Great Seattle Fire of 1889. The JFB occupies one full block in Seattle&rsquo;s downtown waterfront neighborhood and is bounded by First Avenue on the west, Madison Street on the north, Second Avenue on the east, and Marion Street on the south. Construction of this 36 story, 854,000 square foot building began with the demolition of the historic Burke Building (a few features were preserved such as a granite arch now located on the Second Avenue side of the JFB). The JFB is home to over 35 agencies and more than 2,300 employees. Many of the original tenant agencies, which began to occupy space in 1974, still reside in the building. As the largest federal office building with the greatest number of occupants, the JFB is considered the &quot;flagship&quot; of federal office buildings in the Pacific Northwest.</p><p><br />&nbsp;</p><p><b>THE VBA VISION:</b><br /><br />Our vision is that the veterans whom we serve will feel that our nation has kept its commitment to them; employees will feel that they are both recognized for their contribution and are part of something larger than themselves; and taxpayers will feel that we've met the responsibilities they've entrusted to us.

As a result, the Continuous Organizational Readiness Evaluation (CORE) program was developed in 1999(?) and signifies the network&rsquo;s ability to meet the needs of patients, stakeholders, accreditation bodies, and others as needed every day without disruption in service. To always be &ldquo;ready,&rdquo; is a long-term commitment that includes the development of our own staff to serve as internal consultants. These consultants assist in the assessment of patient, staff, facility and other customer needs utilizing accreditation standards, Baldrige criteria, and other VISN standards. The internal consultant model is a key tool for identifying common areas for improvement as well as &ldquo;positive practices&rdquo; that can be exported across the VISN.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 10pt; color: black; font-family: Arial\">Our <strong><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-family: Arial\">primary mission</span></strong> remains unchanged - <strong><span style=\"font-family: Arial\">to provide health care to veterans</span></strong>, supported and inextricably linked with our missions of <strong><span style=\"font-family: Arial\">health education</span></strong> and <strong><span style=\"font-family: Arial\">medical research</span></strong>.
